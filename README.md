# TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling.

## Selected Project
### Train Ticket booking Management System
In this project, we will create a ticketing application for local trains. Customers can look into the app to make reservations for local trains and acquire online booking receipts. Customers can print these receipts as proof for traveling. The app comprises two accounts, one Admin account, and the other being a user account. With the help of the Admin account, the Admin can view all the booked tickets of a user. While using the application, users have to fill a ticket booking form to make the reservation.

## Project Title
Our project title will be “TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling”.

To select a project title for our ticket booking system we first had to understand the requirements of the project and also ensure that the scope of the project covered the standard features of our selected programming language, which is C#. We also took into account that our project will cover the standard features of a programming language along with supportive tools and services like Database Management System, REST API support, FrontEnd visualization and Version Control Integration.

Based on these considerations, we propose the project title "TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling." This title conveys the main purpose of the project along with the inclusion of the programming language and the fact that we will be using supportive tools and services.
